summary: About Open Web Docs
---

We are a community of web developers, standards makers, and technology companies that considers web platform documentation to be critical digital infrastructure, and we work cooperatively to ensure its long-term health.

We are funded by corporate and individual donations. To see who has contributed, or to contribute yourself, see our [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/open-web-docs) page.

Currently our work is focused on creating and maintaining content for [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org).

## Who we are
